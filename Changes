    - According to changes in Minion v10.00, now it's possible, for locks, to be

1.03 2019-10-14T15:40:00Z (ebruni)
    - MongoDB's primary key (_id) is an object (BSON::OID) so ids of workers,
      jobs and so on are currently objects too. This is ambiguous because, when
      search for a specific id, Pg backend expected a string and also returned
      ids are strings (integers). To remove this ambiguity, now every external
      reference ids are strings as an hexadecimal rappresentation of internal
      BSON::OID object. If you need the id as an object, backend exports an
      experimental _oid method which converts a 24-length hexadecimal strings
      into a BSON::OID.

    - Solved bug in job->note when no arguments passed (issues/3)
    - Optimization in job->note where now you can set/remove items at one time
